# Delete Media

Let's face it: You don't much in the way of free storage with iCloud (5GB), and if you're paying for storage, then you want to use it for the important stuff â€” not a ton of backups that you really don't need.


## What is an iCloud backup?
iCloud automatically backs up all of the data on your iPhone or iPad every day, so long as the device is connected to Wi-Fi, turned on, locked, and connected to a power source. This makes it easy to restore a device if you need to wipe it or set up a brand new iPhone or iPad with your existing data.

## Here's what gets backed up to iCloud:

* iTunes purchase history
* Photos and videos (unless you have iCloud Photo Library enabled)
* Device settings
* App data
* Home screen and app ogranization
* iMessage, text messages, MMS messages (if restoring, the SIM card used during back up is required)
* Ringtones
* Visual Voicemail password (if restoring, the SIM card used during back up is required)
* Health data
* HomeKit configuration
* It can end up being quite a lot of data, which can take up a good chunk of your iCloud storage.


Why it's good to keep your iCloud backups
Holding onto your iCloud backups means you get to take your data virtually anywhere, with the ability to access and restore your iPhone or iPad's data from just about anywhere. It's particularly handy for folks with multiple devices, especially those who rely on Accessibility settings, since you don't have to manually set everything up again.


Why it's OK to delete iCloud backups
The moment someone recommends deleting a backup, you might look at them in shock and wonder how they even dressed themselves this morning. Relax, Jack. It's OK to delete an iCloud backup because you have your device backed up on your Mac or Windows computer, right? Riiiight???

Get an iTunes backup of your iPhone or iPad going, then you have a backup of your backup, just in case. And don't forget, if you turn iCloud backup on again, your device will still be backed up when you're connected to Wi-Fi, the device is locked, turned on, and connected to power.


How to delete iCloud backups on your iPhone or iPad
Launch the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad.
Tap on your Apple ID right at the top. It should be the name you used to sign up for an Apple ID.

Tap Manage Storage under iCloud.
