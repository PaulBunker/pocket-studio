# Make it sing

Every man, every woman, and their assorted dogs seem to want to get on TV to belt out some terrible pop hit on the way to megastardom. If you believe the hype, we all have a frustrated singer in us, begging to get out. But how to set that singer free?

Here are a few of London's best places to hone your vocal skills and learn how best to grasp a microphone to impress a jury of cynical experts. Others are available, but these ones particularly caught our eye. Please note, you'll have to check with each establishment whether they'll also take on the dog.

## Pop
*Carrie Gardner*

Obviously eyeing up the quickest route to fame in these throwaway times, many a pop singer warbles away without having had the benefit of expert advice. Put yourself ahead of the pack with lessons from Carrie Gardner who, with an honours degree in Popular Music Performance behind her, certainly knows her stuff. Carrie claims there is 'no such thing as tone deaf', which is an aspirational assertion put severely to the test by the noises made by a crowd of Londonists on one of our pub crawls.

Nonetheless if anyone can save us all from sounding like distressed cats it's Carrie, and you can contact her for beginner and more advanced lessons at her Richmond/Twickenham studio via her website.

## Rock
*Rocky Music Studio*

Many schools and tutors lump rock and pop together, as though it's quite the same to wail along to a Lady Gaga record as to scream out some AC/DC. Yet Rocky Music Studio well knows the difference and offers specific training of a budding rocker's voice at their studios in New Malden and Bayswater (or across Skype, if you're not willing to travel). In addition to range, projection, breathing techniques and performance, they also will focus on your chosen rock scream, whether that's a growl, yell scream or the 'pig squeal'. All without completely frazzling your vocal health.

A free consultation via Skype will be followed by a session tailored to your specific needs. Rock on.

## Vocal Technique
*Soho Vocal Tuition*

The experts at Soho Vocal Tuition specialise in vocal technique and teach across all genres. Their in-house teachers will help give you that extra power and range, without you squeezing or cracking, so you can nail every one of those high notes. Then you can sit back and wait for future reviewers to pile acclaim onto your soon-to-be-platinum-selling debut album...

Their studio is on Berwick Street in Soho and you can get in touch via their website.

#Opera
*City Academy*

Arguably, if you've reached adulthood without being able to sing in an operatic style, it may well be too late given the strains it could put on untested vocal chords. This is perhaps reflected in City Academy's 'Taster Opera Singing' course, designed as a fun and light-hearted 60 minute exploration of the operatic repertoire and to see whether you and this tricky genre are meant for each other. If it's not a match made in heaven then no harm done, but if you take to it like a duck to water then you have the 'Improvers' course to look forward to next. You will have to keep an eye on availability, however, as the courses are popular and the taster sessions only pop up a couple of times a year.

City Academy, based near Farringdon, also offers singing lessons in a range of other styles and you can find full details on its website.
