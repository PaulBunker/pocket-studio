Speaking or writing about a source text contributes to deeper comprehension than merely reading since both actions require intense scrutiny and examination. Reading and then engaging in a meaningful and fruitful discussion with others challenges us to extend our thinking, arrive at new insights, and consider different perspectives. Writing about what we read requires critical thinking and active engagement in order to compose a coherent piece for a particular purpose and audience. Therefore, learning experiences that include writing, speaking, and listening tasks foster further introspection and analysis of text.
